# LogBook

- 2017.12.03
    - Mongo db with tables:
        - `users`
        - `projects`
        - `statuses`
        - `tasks`
    - Application responds at
      [www.thegotaskboard.dev:3030](www.thegotaskboard.dev:3030)
      and postpone the `rest` "context root" for the rest services;
    - Back on work to rebase the application on a more structured `go` server
      and `mongodb` as database!
